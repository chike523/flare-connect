<p><strong>13. Errors and Inaccuracies</strong></p>
<p>We make every effort to provide complete, accurate, and up-to-date information on our Service. Unfortunately, it is not possible to ensure that any service is completely free of human or technological errors. Occasionally, our Services may contain typographical mistakes, inaccuracies, or omissions, some of which may relate to pricing and availability, and some information may not be complete or current. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time and to change or update information at any time without prior notice.</p>
<p>We assume no obligation to update, amend, or clarify information in the Service or any Third-Party Service (as defined below), including without limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No specified update or refresh date applied in the Service or on any Third-Party Service, should be taken to indicate that all information in the Service or on any Third-Party Service has been modified or updated.</p>
<p><strong>14. Third-Party Services</strong></p>
<p>At times, the Service may allow you to connect to or communicate with other apps, websites, or services owned, operated, or controlled by third-parties, including those linked to by other Users (“<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”). Links to Third-Party Services are offered strictly for informational and convenience purposes and should not be construed as referrals or endorsements by us of the Third-Party Services. The Third-Party Services are developed and maintained by the respective third parties and are governed by their own terms of service and privacy policies. You should read the privacy policies and terms of service agreements of all Third-Party Services. We are not responsible for the content of Third-Party Services, nor do we make any warranties or representations with regard to the content, accuracy, opinions, warranties, products or services, privacy or security, intellectual property compliance, or links of such Third-Party Services.</p>
<p><strong>15. Server Downtime</strong></p>
<p>Our Service may become unavailable from time to time due to security reasons, legal reasons, technical updates, or other reasons. You agree that we are not obligated to inform you of such downtime — even if we are aware that it may occur — or to provide a reason for it, and that you release us from all liability relating to the unavailability of our Service.</p>
<p><strong>16. Our Copyright</strong></p>
<p>We rely on the uniqueness of its Service and content to distinguish itself from third-party competitors. You agree not to copy, distribute, display, disseminate, or otherwise reproduce any of the information on the Service, including content licensed to us by third parties, without receiving our prior written permission.</p>
<p><strong>17. Trademarks</strong></p>
<p>FLARE, SONGBIRD, and its various image marks (as found on the Service) are trademarks used by us to uniquely identify our Service and business. You agree not to use these phrases anywhere without our prior written consent. Additionally, you agree not to use our trade dress, or copy the look and feel of our Service or its design, without our prior written consent. You agree that this paragraph goes beyond the governing law on intellectual property law and includes prohibitions on any competition that violates the provisions of this paragraph, including starting your own service, whether or not it competes directly or indirectly with us or our Service.</p>
<p><strong>18. Revocation of Consent</strong></p>
<p>We may revoke our consent for your use of our intellectual property, or any other permission granted to you under this Agreement, at any time. You agree that if we so request, you must take immediate action to remove any usage of our intellectual property that you may have engaged in, even if it would cause a loss to you.</p>
<p><strong>19. Copyright &amp; Trademark Infringement</strong></p>
<p>We take copyright infringement very seriously, and we have registered a Copyright Agent with the United States Copyright Office, which limits our liability under the <em>Digital Millennium Copyright Act </em>(DMCA). If you believe that your copyright has been infringed, please send us a message which contains:</p>

<li>The name and description of the work that is being infringed.</li>
<li>The location on our Website of the infringing copy.</li>

<li>A statement that you swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in this notification is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or have an exclusive right in law to bring infringement proceedings with respect to its use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Flare Ecosystems Limited</p>
<p>c/o Altairian Limited</p>
<p>20-22 Wenlock Road</p>

<p>Although law may not provide for a similar procedure for trademark infringement, we recommend that you send us similar information to that above in regard to any allegation of trademark infringement, and we will address it as soon as practicable.</p>
<p><strong>20. Communications Decency Act &amp; Constitutional Protection</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the DMCA provisions above, United States law include Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act<em> </em>and the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, create a defense for us for the actions of third parties in regard to any defamatory content posted on our Service. Although we are not liable for defamatory words posted on our Service by our Users even if given notice, we do prohibit defamation under this Agreement and we may, if we believe the situation warrants it, take action against the offending User. Please notify us at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fd94939b92bd9b919c8f98d39398898a928f96">[email&#160;protected]</a> if any of our Users have posted anything that you believe is defamatory. Note that administrators and management should, ideally, be the first party you contact in response to any defamation by another User.</p>
<p><strong>21. Representations &amp; Warranties</strong></p>
<p>WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE MERCHANTABILITY OF OUR SERVICE OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE RELEASING US FROM ANY LIABILITY THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO YOU IN RELATION TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES, FOR REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FAILURE OF OUR SERVICE, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER TORT. TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW RESTRICTS THIS RELEASE OF LIABILITY, YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY LIABLE TO YOU FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT THE LAW RESTRICTS OUR LIABILITY TO, IF SUCH A MINIMUM EXISTS.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY USE OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PEOPLE WHO COMMIT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, DEFAMATION, TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH ECONOMIC RELATIONS, OR ANY OTHER ACTIONABLE CONDUCT TOWARDS YOU.</p>
<p>WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ACTIONS BY AN ADMINISTRATOR, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE, OR OTHER USER WHICH MAY CAUSE HARM TO YOU, EVEN IF WE BECOME AWARE IN ADVANCE THAT SUCH ACTIONS MAY OR WILL OCCUR AND DO NOT NOTIFY YOU.</p>
<p>WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ERRORS IN INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH OUR SERVICE OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE THAT MAY ARISE FROM SUCH CONTENT.</p>
<p>WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY FAILURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR SERVICE OR A THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING ANY FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS WHICH PREVENT ACCESS TO OUR SERVICE TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY.</p>
<p>THE PROVISION OF OUR SERVICE TO YOU IS CONTINGENT ON YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THIS AND ALL OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN THE PROVISIONS OF THIS “REPRESENTATIONS &amp; WARRANTIES” SECTION SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT THE GENERALITY OF THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION.</p>
<p><u>For Jurisdictions that Do Not Allow Us to Limit Our Liability</u></p>
<p>Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law. Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.</p>
<p>Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions not in the United States do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States, foreign, and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. Your promise and agree to use the Service in strict compliance with any local, domestic, national, and/or territorial laws, rules, and regulation that are or may be applicable.</p>
<p><strong>22. Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us and any of our affiliates, employees, officers, directors, agents, successors, and assigns for any claims by you or any third party which may arise from or relate to this Agreement or the provision of our Service to you, including any damages caused by your use of our Service, or the permitted use by others of your license and User Account. You also agree that you have a duty to defend us against such claims and we may require you to pay for an attorney(s) of our choice in such cases. You agree that this indemnity extends to requiring you to pay for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements. In the event of a claim such as one described in this paragraph, we may elect to settle with the party/parties making the claim, and you shall be liable for the damages as though we had proceeded with a trial.</p>
<p><strong>23. Assignment</strong></p>
<p>We may assign or delegate this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>24. Choice of Law</strong></p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by English law in force in the United Kingdom. The offer and acceptance of this contract are deemed to have occurred in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>25. Forum of Dispute</strong></p>
<p>Except as specifically stated herein, all Disputes shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration. You hereby waive your right to have any future Dispute heard by a judge or jury (except as otherwise set forth in this Section 25). The provisions of this Section 25 shall constitute your and Flare’s written agreement to arbitrate Disputes before a three (3) arbitrator panel in the London Court of International Arbitration in London, England. Any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by you and Flare.</p>
<p>You agree that you may bring claims against us only in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. In addition, you agree that disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.</p>
<p>You agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action shall be permanently barred.</p>
<p>If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements in doing so.</p>
<p>You agree that any Dispute that, for whatever reason, is deemed not subject to the jurisdiction requirements set forth above shall be subject to exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of London, England in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>26. Force Majeure</strong></p>
<p>You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption, unavailability of payment processors, failure or shortage of infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.</p>
<p><strong>27. Severability</strong></p>
<p>In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.</p>
<p>If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, we shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.</p>
<p><strong>28. Non-Waiver</strong></p>
<p>We reserve all rights afforded to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.</p>
<p><strong>29. Termination &amp; Cancellation</strong></p>
<p>We may terminate your access to our Service at our discretion without explanation, though we will strive to provide a timely explanation in most cases. Under no circumstances, including termination or cancellation of our Service to you, will we be liable for any losses related to actions of other Users.</p>
<p><strong>30. Assignment of Rights</strong></p>
<p>You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our discretion.</p>
<p><strong>31. Corporate Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>36. Accessing, Editing &amp; Removing Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Users may in some cases be able to review and edit the personal information they have provided to us by logging into their account and editing their information. Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in your web browser’s cache or app’s local memory. We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such. In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.</p>
<p><strong>37. Cookies, Web Beacons, Browser Local Storage &amp; Similar Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or other devices by websites that you visit.</p>
<p>We may use cookies for various purposes including, but not limited to, remembering your preferences, maintaining user sessions, improving security of our services, collecting usage information, and targeting ads.</p>
<p>Since cookies are used to maintain user sessions, it is necessary that you enable cookies in your browser to be able to log into the Service, and you hereby acknowledge that we have informed you of our use of cookies and that you consent to our use of cookies in relation to the platform by which you are accessing our Service.</p>
<p>We may use the Web Storage API (a.k.a, local or session storage) provided by your browser or app to cache information related to your account, including your personal data.</p>
<p>We may use various third-party services that may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information. Such services include, but not limited to, web analytics services, advertisement services, and social media services.</p>
<p>This Agreement does not cover cookies practices used by third-party service providers. We will do our best to maintain links to privacy policies of the third-party service providers that we use in this document.</p>
<p><strong>38. Third-Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>We may post links to third-party websites on our Service. Additionally, other materials made available through our Service may contain third-party website links or files. We do not screen third-party websites or files for privacy or security issues, and you release us from any liability for the conduct or content of these third parties.</p>
<p>Please be aware that this Agreement, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service. We bear no responsibility for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third-party website. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit.</p>
<p><strong>39. Third-Party Access to Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Although you are entering into an agreement with us to disclose your information to us, we do use third-party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, advertising partners, web hosting companies, and others.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our Service.</p>
<p>It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Agreement. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Agreement, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our Service or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>
<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to collect, share, store, exchange, and otherwise use your information in conjunction with the Service.</p>
<p>This Section 39 shall not apply to your PHI held by us which shall only be used in accordance with the consent set forth in Section 34 above.</p>
<p><strong>40. Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</strong></p>
<p>At times, it may become necessary or desirable, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p>
<p><strong>41. Commercial &amp; Non-Commercial Communications</strong></p>
<p>By providing information to the Service that forms the basis of communication with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email from us since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication from us or anyone else covered under this Agreement. However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying us that you no longer wish to receive solicitations or information and we will endeavor to remove you from the database.</p>
<p><strong>42. Security Measures</strong></p>
<p>We take certain measures to enhance the security of our Service, specifically: (i) the Service is protected by multiple firewalls including secure access; (ii) Our infrastructure provider also functions as IDS/IPS capable of detecting and thwarting cyber-attacks such as DDoS, SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, etc.; (iii) the Service is protected by SSL certificates that encrypts all ingress and egress traffic; (iv) Network Security Groups (NSG) allow only the intended traffic to traverse between the servers hosting the application; and (v) periodic vulnerability assessment and penetration testing is carried out on the Service. We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p><strong>43. Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>44. Your Legal Rights</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p><u>Request access</u> to your personal data (commonly known as a &#8220;data subject access request&#8221;). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p><u>Request correction</u> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p><u>Request erasure</u> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p><u>Object to processing</u> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><u>Request restriction</u> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish the data&#8217;s accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p><u>Request the transfer</u> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</p>
<p><u>Withdraw consent</u> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide our Service to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p><u>No fee usually required</u> so that you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><u>Time limit to respond</u> to your legitimate requests will be one (1) month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our DPM (see above).</p>
<p><strong>45. Your California Online Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>We permit residents of California to use our Service. Therefore, it is our intent to comply with the <em>California Business and Professions Code</em> §§ 22575-22579. If you are a California resident you may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Various provisions throughout this Agreement address requirements of the Californian privacy statutes. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors. You may contact us at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="30595e565f70565c5142551e5e5544475f425b">[email&#160;protected]</a> with any questions.</p>
<p><strong>46. International Transfer</strong></p>
<p>We share your personal data within the company group. If you are located in the European Union, this will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) because we are a UK-based company. We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. These rules are called &#8220;binding corporate rules&#8221;. Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please contact our DPM (see Section 34) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
<p><strong>47. Amendments</strong></p>
<p>We may amend this Agreement from time to time. When we amend this Agreement, we will post the changes here. Your continued use of our Service shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. Historic versions can be obtained by contacting our DPM (see Section 34).</p>
